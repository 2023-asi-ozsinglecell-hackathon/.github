# ASI Systems Immunology x OzSingleCell Hackathon 2023

We are excited to announce the return of the ASI - OzSingleCell Hackathon in 2023. 
It will take place on the 23rd-25th October 2023 in Melbourne prior to the OzSingleCell annual conference (25-27th Oct). 
This year's theme is focused on "Clonal Biology" and will bring together early-career researchers and leaders in single cell genomics, clonal biology, and immunology to tackle some of the grand challenges that exist in the analysis and interpretation of clonally-related cells in single-cell genomic datasets.
